            <h2 class="greeting">Hey guys,</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="headertext">This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> - 
            <br> another important game guideline.</p>
        </div>

            <div class="content0">
                <div class="textcontent">
                    <h3>Youtubability</h3>
                    <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong>the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.
                    <br> 
                    Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong>the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.
                    <br>
                    Many elements can be used to make your game clearer:
                    <br>
                    For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong>evident</strong>, 
                    for example, can she tell which character she <strong>controls?</strong> Is the <strong>objective clear?</strong>
                    Does it look <strong>fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).
                    <br>
                    Make sure to <strong>use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong>clearly contrasted</strong> 
                    (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.

                    <p>
                        If you want to run user tests with f riends and family or even random people in the street, 
                        it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order 
                        to <strong>understand their</strong> expectations from the video vs. the actual game they try.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong>understand the objective and controls</strong> 
                        of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the 
                        space dedicated to drawing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong>on their phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, 
                        everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. 
                        <strong>You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches iton a small screen.</strong>
                        With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong>accelerated elevator pitch!</strong>
                        <br> 
                        Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail 
                        - it’s the same idea for your game videos.
